# Welcome to My Malloc
***

## Task

In this project, I have to use the heap by recreating our own implementation of malloc
Malloc is a dynamic memory allocator â€” it gives you a block of memory on the heap during run time
You want to use malloc when you don't know the memory size during compile time.
It's also useful when you need to allocate memory greater than the size of the stack.
More commonly, malloc is used for objects that must exist beyond the scope of the current block.
To reserve memory from the heap, we used to do reserve memory by calling the syscall sbrk, but it has been deprecated on OS X.
And I had to learn about how memory manegemnt works on my computer when I run a programm.

## Description

First of all I had to learn more deeply about so many concepts like memory manegement , and more how occurs memory leaks,
how to use binary tree in heap data structure and void * , and I evenly learned  from software to hardware of computer to understand
what really happens when I run a program on my computer meoey system , and little bit about CPU , Motherboard , and Universal zero initializer from
my aggregate types namely structures and arrays , and I learned how to use linked list to binary tree method to store data of  left and right childs
and I learned more about stack , RAM ,  and amazing informations about memory manegement.

## Installation

I did not used any installation in my project.

## Usage

You can use my porject with gcc and ./a.out  , make and ./my_malloc.
