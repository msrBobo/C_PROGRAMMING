# Welcome to My Sqlite
***

## Task
Readline is a standard library that allows for easy interaction with the command line by providing methods for reading input from the user.
It provides several methods for reading user input, including readline, gets, and getc.I did not understand the essence of readline a bit.
But I used it as much as I can. The challenge was to understand the work of sql. Problems arose many times, but I deleted the code and wrote again.
It works like it always does. Define the problem: Start by identifying exactly what the problem is. At this stage, it is important to formulate the 
problem as precisely and clearly as possible in order to understand what exactly needs to be worked on.

## Description
I basically solved my problems with a mentor
or with google and if it didn't work I asked my friends.
But Google and YouTube helped me the most
