## Task

In this project, I had to know how we write a calculator program in the C programming language.
A Calculator is a small electronic device used to perform various arithmetic operations like addition,
 subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, etc.
It makes our calculations easier and faster. It is a portable device that can use anywhere to perform,
simple mathematical operations.We use a scientific or sophisticated calculator in some situations,
where we need to solve complex calculations like trigonometry functions, exponential operators,
degrees, radians, log functions, hyperbolic functions etc.

## Description

First of all I really did not use any calculator to solve any task with brackets before
In this task I have to check the input valid or not then brackets
I have to find bracket that I have to open and solve before other actions after I take one area of bracket
I continue solving task with multipling or (adding and so . on ) two numbers
then In my function I had to solve all tasks at all.

## Installation

I did not need any installation in my project

## Usage

you can use it with both of them make or gcc
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
